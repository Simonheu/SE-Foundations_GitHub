<p>
  This is a super simple python CGI server. This page is rendered from a single HTML file with no CSS. <br>
  When you enter text into the name field below, the client will use the HTML POST method to send that text back the server. <br>
  The server will then call a python script which access the text, parses it, and sends a response as HTML, which the browser then renders.
</p>
<form action="/scriptspost/parseForm.py" method="post">
#the action attribute specifies where the information of the form should be sent to. (in this case to the file parseForm.py)
#method, describes the method that should be used. post is the more secure method (instead of get) and is reccomended
